cookiecutter-supercollider-plugin
=================================

A [cookiecutter] project template for [SuperCollider] server plugins.

To create a SuperCollider server plugin using this template, first
[install cookiecutter][installation instructions].

This cookiecutter template requires at least Python 3.2. If you have multiple versions of python and
are installing via `pip`, you may need to be explicit about which version of Python you use to
install it to ensure cookiecutter uses a compatible version. For example, on macOS with Python 3.7:

    $ python3.7 -m pip install cookiecutter

Then run:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/supercollider/cookiecutter-supercollider-plugin

and answer the questionnaire. See the [cookiecutter documentation] on how to change the default
values for these prompts.

After filling out the questionnaire, cookiecutter will clone the project, fill in placeholders with
your supplied information, run a Python script from the SuperCollider project to set up your CMake
files, and finally set up a git repository.

Here is an example:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/brianlheim/cookiecutter-supercollider-plugin
    full_path_to_supercollider_source [/home/wendy/supercollider (if you haven't cloned it yet, do that first! Press Ctrl-C to exit this script.]: /Users/brianheim/git/supercollider

    full_name [Wendy Carlos]: Brian Heim

    Done!

Enter the directory and build the project:

    $ cd simplegain
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. DSC_PATH=/path/to/supercollider/source -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    $ cmake --build . --config Debug

If you add more plugins, or add or remove files, make sure to regenerate the CMakeLists.txt file
using the generation script. See the README in `tools/cmake_gen` for more info, or run the script
with `--help`.

    $ python ../supercollider/tools/cmake_gen/generate_server_plugin_cmake.py --help

Explanation of questionnaire terms:

- project\_name: The name of the project, used in the README and CMakeLists.txt. Furthermore, the
  project\_name with spaces removed will be used as the base install folder.
- project\_namespace: C++ namespace for your plugin(s).
- repo\_name: GitHub repository name
- plugin\_name: Name of the first plugin in your project

Licensing
---------

The generated project will be GPLv3-licensed. **Make sure that you change the LICENSE file if you
want to use a more permissive license!**

Advanced instructions
---------------------

### Continuous Integration: Travis-CI and AppVeyor

Your auto-generated project will contain configuration files for the [Travis-CI][Travis] and
[AppVeyor] integration services. These are tools that let you see how your project compiles on a
totally fresh and isolated system. The Travis-CI script is configured for building on Linux (Ubuntu
14.04) and MacOS; the AppVeyor script is configured for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows builds.

Every time you update your remote repository on GitHub, these scripts will run so you can see
whether or not your project builds properly in each of the tested environments.

To enable these services, you need to create accounts with both Travis-CI and AppVeyor, then follow
their instructions for adding projects. Do this after you create your repository on GitHub.

Travis: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/

AppVeyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/signup

### GitHub Deployment

Your auto-generated project will contain configuration that makes it easy to deploy pre-built
versions of your library to GitHub.

For AppVeyor:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a new token with `repo` scope. Make sure to
   save the token if you want to use it later.
2. Go to https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt and encrypt your token.
3. Paste the encrypted token into `.appveyor.yml`, at the line with `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`.
4. Uncomment the `deploy` section of `.appveyor.yml`.

For Travis-CI:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a new token with `repo` scope, or use the
   same token you generated for AppVeyor. Make sure to save the token if you want to use it later.
2. Sign in to https://travis-ci.org, go to your repository, and click "More options" -> "Settings".
3. Under Environment Variables enter a new variable. Set the Name to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, set the Value
   to the raw token you got from GitHub, make sure "Display value in build log" is turned _off_, and
   click "Add." Travis will ensure that your token is never visible as plaintext in the log for your
   project.
4. You don't need to modify `.travis.yml` at all.

If you run into issues with permissions, double-check that you have given your token(s) `repo`
scope.

### Newer compiler toolchains in Travis

If you want a newer compiler toolchain than what is currently being used for Travis's Linux builds,
check https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/cpp/#c11c11-and-beyond-and-toolchain-versioning.
This is especially relevant if you would like to build with a higher C++ standard than C++11.

Requirements
------------

* Basic development tools (C++ compiler, cmake, etc.)
* Python >= 3.2
* Git
